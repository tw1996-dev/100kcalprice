        <h1>How much do 100 calories cost?</h1>
    </header>

    <main id="mainPageMain">

        <p>You're in the store. You look at shelves full of products. Prices per kilogram are visible, labels clearly
            state the <em>energy value</em>... but do you really know <strong>how cost-effective a given product
                is?</strong></p>
        
        <p>Are you aware that <strong>some products are indeed several times more expensive than others</strong>?</p>

        <div class="home-highlight-box">
            <p>This page was created to answer precisely that question. With this <em>simple calculator</em>, you'll
                calculate in <em>just a few seconds</em> how much 100 calories of a given product cost you â€“ it's a
                <strong>quick and practical way to compare the cost-effectiveness of different food options</strong>.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>This calculator will be useful for anyone who:</h2>
        <ul id="mainPageul">
            <li>controls <strong>daily calorie intake</strong></li>
            <li>wants to make <strong>informed purchasing decisions</strong></li>
            <li>looks for ways to <strong>save money</strong>, <em>without compromising on quality</em></li>
        </ul>

        <div class="home-cta-text">
            <p>The best part is that you can have this calculator <strong>always at hand</strong> â€“ all you need is a phone
                and access to the website. <strong>Calculating the cost of 100 kcal</strong> will take you literally <em>10
                    seconds</em>, even <em>while standing at the store shelf</em>.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Why is it worth calculating calorie cost?</h2>

        <p>In a world where <strong>food is getting more expensive</strong>, it's worth knowing not only <strong>how
                much 1 kg of a given product costs</strong>, but also <strong>how much you'll pay for its energy
                value</strong>. Especially if you're <em>counting calories</em>, <em>losing weight</em>,
            <em>training</em>, or simply want to have <strong>greater awareness</strong> of what you're buying.</p>

        <div class="home-highlight-box">
            <p>Remember â€“ calorie counting is not just a <em>way to diet</em>, but also <strong>real control over
                    expenses</strong> and a better <strong>understanding of the value of what we eat</strong>. And while
                <strong>price matters</strong>, let's not forget: <strong>product quality</strong> <em>always remains
                    key</em>.</p>

    <h2>ðŸ’¡ Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
    
    <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>What is a 100 kcal cost calculator?</h3>
        <p>A 100 kcal cost calculator is a tool that helps you determine how much you pay for 100 calories from different food products. Instead of just comparing prices per kilogram, it shows you the actual energy cost, helping you make smarter shopping decisions and find the most budget-friendly sources of calories.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Why should I compare food prices by calorie content?</h3>
        <p>Comparing food by calorie cost reveals the true value of what you're buying. For example, nuts might seem expensive per kilogram, but they're energy-dense and might actually provide cheaper calories than some processed snacks. This is especially valuable for people counting calories, managing food budgets, or trying to lose weight cost-effectively.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>How much money can I save by using this calculator?</h3>
        <p>Users typically save 15-30% on their grocery bills by identifying the most cost-effective sources of calories. By switching from expensive low-calorie foods to cheaper high-energy alternatives when appropriate, you can significantly reduce your cost per calorie while maintaining your nutritional goals.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Is this calculator useful for weight loss?</h3>
        <p>Yes! When losing weight, you need fewer calories, so every calorie should count both nutritionally and financially. The calculator helps you find affordable, filling foods that provide good value per calorie, making it easier to stick to your diet without breaking your budget.</p>
