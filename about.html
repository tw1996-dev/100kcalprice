    <h2>Why is it worth calculating calorie cost?</h2>

<p>The goal of this website is to help you make <strong>smarter purchasing decisions</strong> â€“ ones that are good for both <strong>your health</strong> and <strong>your wallet</strong>.</p>

<p>In a world where <strong>food is getting more expensive</strong>, it's worth knowing not only <strong>how much 1 kg of a given product costs</strong>, but also <strong>how much you'll pay for its energy value</strong>. Especially if you're <em>counting calories</em>, <em>losing weight</em>, <em>training</em>, or simply want to have <strong>greater awareness</strong> of what you're buying.</p>

<p>This calculator doesn't judge what you should eat â€“ it just gives you a tool so you can <strong>compare products in terms of cost-effectiveness</strong> yourself. This is particularly helpful when you are:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>planning a diet</strong></li>
    <li><strong>on a limited budget</strong></li>
    <li><strong>wanting to choose smarter</strong></li>
    <li><strong>looking to save money</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Remember, however, that <strong>the price per 100 kcal</strong> is just one aspect. It's also worth paying attention to the <strong>ingredients</strong>, <strong>quality</strong>, and <strong>nutritional value of products</strong> â€“ because <strong>health is priceless</strong>.</p>
